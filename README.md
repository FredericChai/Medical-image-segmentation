# Medical-image-segmentation
This repo implement several finetuned segmentation model (Unet-vgg,Unet_resnet, Refinenet,FCN) pretrained on ImageNet for medical image analysis (e.g. Ultrasound, Skin lesion, medical sub-figure). 

It implements popular models in medical image analysis.  The original dataset is from imageclef and isic. We finetuned model for 200 epochs. The learning rate was initially set to 0.01 and decreased to 1e-3 after 50 epochs. We trained our model using a dice loss and it took ~2 hours to train on  a 12GB NVIDIA TITAN V GPU. 

## Requirements
- [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) (Recommended version 9.2)
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)

## Results
